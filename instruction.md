* Only one thing can be worse than the attempt to carry out rules whose principles are not understood; and that is the neglect of those which are understood, and seen to be right.
* Never show that you doubt, except you are able to convict. To doubt
  an honest child is to do what you can to make a liar of him; and to
  believe a liar, if he is not altogether shameless, is to shame him.
* Instil no religious doctrine apart from its duty. If it have no duty
  as its necessary embodiment, the doctrine may well be regarded as
  doubtful.
* but being confident that instruction for which the mind is not
  prepared only lies in a rotting heap, producing all kinds of mental
  evils correspondent to the results of successive loads of food which
  the system cannot assimilate, my hope had been to rouse wise
  questions in the minds of my children, in place of overwhelming
  their digestions with what could be of no instruction or edification
  without the foregoing appetite
* the father, unlike most prudent men, did not think it necessary to
  warn his son against too sure an expectation, and so prepare him for
  the consequence of a possible mistake; he did not imagine that
  disappointment, like the small-pox, requires the vaccination of
  apprehension--that a man, lest he should be more miserable
  afterwards, must make himself miserable now.
* To him that obeys well, the truth comes easy; to him who does not
  obey, it comes not, or comes in forms of fear and dismay.
* When a man reasons for victory and not for the truth in the other
  soul, he is sure of just one ally, the same that Faust had in
  fighting Gretchen's brother--that is, the Devil.
* Nothing, I repeat, so much as humble ministration to your
    neighbours, will help you to that perfect love of God which
    casteth out fear;
* For the sooner the children are brought under right influences--I do
  not mean a great deal of religious speech, but the right influences
  of truth and honesty, and an evident regard to what God wants of
  us--not only are they the more easily wrought upon, but the sooner
  do they recognize those influences as right and good.
* That is what I have to teach you: mere telling is not much use.
  Telling is what makes people think they know when they do not, and
  makes them foolish
* I should have said that when we know a little about a person, and
  are used to hearing his name, then we are ready to think we know all
  about him
* People that talk about good things without doing them are left out.
  You are not master of addition until your addition is to be depended
  upon
* spending their strength in avoiding precipices and getting out of
  bogs, mourning and sighing over their sins instead of leaving them
  behind and fleeing to the Father
* It is one of the poorest of human weaknesses that a man should be
  ashamed of saying he has done wrong, instead of so ashamed of having
  done wrong that he cannot rest till he has said so; for the shame
  cleaves fast until the confession removes it
* He does not care for the praise that comes before obedience!
* the best a father can do, is to enable his son to earn his
  livelihood in the exercise of a genial and righteous labor
* A little wonder is worth tons of knowledge.
* Man is made, not to contemplate himself, but to behold in others the
  beauty of the Father
* Many think it a horrible thing to say there is no God, who never
  think how much worse a thing it is not to heed Him. If God be not
  worth minding, what great ruin can it be to imagine His
  non-existence?
* The confession of not being, is the sole foundation for becoming
* Everything, the commonest, well done, is something for the progress
  of the world; that is, lessens, if by the smallest hair's-breadth,
  the distance between it and God.
* "But what is the right tune of a body's life, father?" "The will of God, my boy." "But how is a person to know that, father?" "By trying to do what he knows of it already. Everybody has a different kind of tune in his life, and no one can find out another's tune for him, though he may help him to find it for himself." "But aren't we to read the Bible, father?" "Yes, if it's in order to obey it. To read the Bible thinking to please God by the mere reading of it, is to think like a heathen." "And aren't we to say our prayers, father?" "We are to ask God for what we want. If we don't want a thing, we are only
