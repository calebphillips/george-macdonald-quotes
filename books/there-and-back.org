John cast aside an allegiance to God which had never been more than a mockery, and set about delivering his race from the fear of a person who did not exist.

For, true enough, there was no God of the kind John denied; only, what if, in delivering his kind from the tyranny of a false God, he aided in hiding from them the love of a true God--of a God that did and ought to exist? There are other passions besides fear, and precious as fear is hateful. If there be a God and one has never sought him, it will be small consolation to remember that he could not get proof of his existence. Is a child not to seek his father, because he cannot prove he is alive?

But what was the thing he thus glorified? Liberty to go where you pleased, do what you liked, say what you chose!--that was all. Of inward liberty, of freedom from mental or spiritual oppression, from passion, from prejudice, from envy, from jealousy, from selfishness, from unfairness, from ambition, from false admiration, from the power of public opinion, from any motive energy save that of love and truth--a freedom of which outward freedom is scarce the shadow--of such liberty, for all the good books he had read, for all the good poems he had admired, Richard had not yet begun to dream, not to say think.

But here let me remark that it depends partly on the degree of a man's moral development, whether this or that book will be to him degrading or otherwise. A book which one man ought to scorn, may be of elevating tendency to another, because it is a little above his present moral condition. A book which to enjoy would harm a more delicate mind, may perhaps benefit the nature that would have chosen a coarser book still. We cannot determine the operation of energies, when we do not know on what moral level they are at work.

He had yet to learn that a man and a Christian are precisely and entirely the same thing; that a being who is not a Christian is not a man.

No one, however strong he may feel his obligations, will ever be man enough to fulfill them except he be a Christian--that is, one who, like Christ, cares first for the will of the Father. One who thinks he can meet his obligations now, can have no idea what is required of him in virtue of his being what he is--no idea of what his own nature requires of him.

If a man say, 'I cannot believe; I was not made to believe what I could not prove;' I reply, Do you really say, 'It is not true,' because you have no proof?

Second Reading

What a society is that which will regard as reformed the man whom
assuaging fires have left an exhausted slag—a thing for which as yet
no use is known, who suggests no promise of change or growth, gives no
poorest hint of hope concerning his fate!

To become able to make something is, I think, necessary to thorough
development. I would rather have son of mine a carpenter, a
watchmaker, a wood-carver, a shoemaker, a jeweller, a blacksmith, a
bookbinder, than I would have him earn his bread as a clerk in a
counting-house.

It is the privilege of some kinds of labour, that they are compatible
with thoughts of higher things.

religious system brought to bear on his youth had operated but feebly
on his conscience, and not at all on his affections. It had, however,
so wrought upon his apprehensions, that, when afterward persuaded
there was no ground for agonizing anticipation, he welcomed the
conviction as in itself a redemption for all men; "for, surely," he
argued, "fear is the worst of evils!"

John Tuke did right so far as he knew—at least he thought he did—and
refused to believe in any kind of God; Jane did right, she thought, as
far as she knew—and never imagined God cared about her: let him who
has a mind to it, show the value of the difference!

A man will be judged, however, by his truth toward what he professes
to believe;

and John was far truer to his perception of the duty of man to man
than are ninety-nine out of the hundred of so-called Christians to the
things they profess to believe.

You see, lad, when I was a boy, I thought everything my mother said
and my father did, old-fashioned, and a bit ignorant-like; but when I
was a man, I saw that, if I had started right off from where they set
me down, I would ha' been farther ahead. To honour your father an'
mother don't mean to stick by their chimbley-corner all your life, but

All things belong to every man who yields his selfishness, which is
his one impoverishment, and draws near to his wealth, which is
humanity—not humanity in the abstract, but the humanity of friends and
neighbours and all men. Selfishness, I repeat, whether in the form of
vanity or greed, is our poverty.

A man's patent of manhood is, that he can call upon God—not the God of
any theology, right or wrong, but the God out of whose heart he came,
and in whose heart he is. This is his highest power—that which
constitutes his original likeness to God.

She had, that is, an oppressive sense of the claims of a supernal
power, but no feeling of the relationship which gives those claims, no
knowledge of the loving help offered with the presentation of the
claims.

There are those to whom the present cannot be good save as a mode of
the infinite. In such their divine origin asserts itself. Once known
for what it is, the poorest present is a phial holding the elixir of
life.

But in truth Richard had hardly yet begun to think. He only followed
the things that came to him; he never said to things, Come; neither,
when they came, did he keep them, and make them walk up and down
before him till he saw what they were; he did not search out their
pedigree, get them to give an account of themselves, show what they
could do, or, in short, be themselves to him.

Liberty to go where you pleased, do what you liked, say what you
chose!—that was all. Of inward liberty, of freedom from mental or
spiritual oppression, from passion, from prejudice, from envy, from
jealousy, from selfishness, from unfairness, from ambition, from false
admiration, from the power of public opinion, from any motive energy
save that of love and truth—a freedom of which outward freedom is
scarce the shadow—of such liberty, for all the good books he had read,
for all the good poems he had admired, Richard had not yet begun to
dream, not to say think.

Lestrange had never thought whether the wish to appear might not
indicate the duty to be; had never seen that, until he was, to desire

inspiring the honest with confidence, and giving little hope to the
designing.

Yet was it the presence all the time of that father he refused that
made it possible for him to drink the water of any poorest little well
of salvation that sprang in the field of his life; and such a well was
his work among books.

But here let me remark that it depends partly on the degree of a man's
moral development, whether this or that book will be to him degrading
or otherwise. A book which one man ought to scorn, may be of elevating
tendency to another, because it is a little above his present moral
condition. A book which to enjoy would harm a more delicate mind, may
perhaps benefit the nature that would have chosen a coarser book
still. We cannot determine the operation of energies, when we do not
know on what moral level they are at work.

a favourite but pagan phrase,

It is the home-born impulse of every true heart to give of its best,
to infect with its own joy;

"I don't believe you. And I won't worship him." "Why, who wants you to
worship him? You must be a very different person before he will care
much for your worship! You can't worship him while you think him what
you do. He is something quite different. You don't know him to love,
and you don't know him to worship."

Do you think he would have you worship a being such as you take him to
be. If your son is in good company in the other world, he must be
greatly troubled at the way you treat God—at your unfairness to
him. But your bad example may, for anything I know, have sent him
where he has not yet begun to learn anything!"

It is difficult to say how much man or woman is the worse for doing,
when freed from restraint, what he or she would have been glad to do
before, but for the restraint. Many who go to the colonies, and there
to the dogs, only show themselves such as they dared not appear at
home: they step on a steeper slope, and arrive, not at the pit, for
they were in that already, but at the bottom of it, so much the
faster.

Every time we grumble at our fate, every time we are displeased, hurt,
resentful at this or that which comes to us, every time we do not
receive the suffering sent us, "with both hands," as William Law says,
we are of the same spirit with this half-crazy woman.

Now the whole good of things is to be the messengers of love—to carry
love from the one heart to the other heart;

and when these messengers are fetched instead of sent, grasped at,
that is, by a greedy, ungiving hand, they never reach the heart, but
block up the path of love, and divide heart from heart; so that the
greedy heart forgets the love of the giving heart more and more, and
all by the things it gives. That is the way generosity fares with the
ungenerous.


To oppose, to refuse, to deny, is not to know the truth, is not to be
true any more than it is to be false.

Whatever good may lie in the destroying of the false, the best hammer
of the iconoclast will not serve withal to carve the celestial form of
the Real; and when the iconoclast becomes the bigot of negation, and
declares the non-existence of any form worthy of worship, because he
has destroyed so many unworthy, he passes into a fool. That he has
never conceived a deity such as he could worship, is a poor ground to
any but the man himself for saying such cannot exist; and to him it is
but a ground lightly vaulted over the vacuity self-importance.

idea, namely, of a being to call God, who was a delight to think of,

Instead of blaming as a matter of course the person who does not
believe in a God, we should think first whether his notional God is a
God that ought, or a God that ought not to be believed in.

"No, I haven't. But there's an undertow bringing us on to each
other. It would spoil all if he thought I threw a net for him. I do
mean to catch him if I can, but I will not move till the tide brings
him into my arms.

At least, that is how the thing looks to me at present. I believe
enough not to make haste. I don't want to throw salt on any bird's
tail, but I do want the birds to come hopping about me, that I may
tell them what I know!"

It is strange that the man who most keenly feels the wrong done him,
should so often be the most insensible to the wrong he does. So
dominant is the unreason of the moment, that the injury he inflicts
appears absolute justice, and the injury he suffers absolute
injustice.

"Because I can," answered Wingfold. "To believe and to be able to
prove, have little or nothing to do with each other. To believe and to
convince have much to do with each other."

Shall I search heaven and earth for proof that my wife is a good and
lovely woman? The signs of it are everywhere; the proofs of it
nowhere."

"That the God will tell them, to their satisfaction, so soon as ever
they shall have become capable of understanding it. There must be
things so entirely beyond our capacity, that we cannot now see enough
of them to be able even to say that they are incomprehensible. There
must be millions of truths that have not yet risen above the horizon
of what we call the finite."

If a man had the same notion of God that I have, or anything like it,
and did not at least desire that there might be such a God, then I
confess I should have difficulty in understanding how he could be
good. But the God offered him might not be worth believing in, might
even be such that it was a virtuous act to refuse to believe in him."


Why should he be able to think anything too good to be true? Why
should a thing not be true because it was good?

"If he believed the idea of him so good, yet did not desire such a
being enough to wish that he might be, enough to feel it worth his
while to cry out, in some fashion or other, after him, then I could
not help suspecting something wrong in his will, or his moral nature
somewhere; or, perhaps, that the words he spoke were but words, and
that he did not really and truly feel that the idea of such a God was
too good to be true.

"But suppose he was a man who tried to do right, who tried to help his
neighbour, who was at least so far a good man as to deny the God that
most people seem to believe in—what would you say then?" "I would say,
'Have patience.' If there be a good God, he cannot be altogether
dissatisfied with such a man.

He was a servant of the church universal, of all that believed or ever
would believe in the Lord Christ, therefore of all men, of the whole
universe—and

it is so easy for those who lie to believe that another is lying! It
is impossible indeed for such to imagine that another, with what they
would count strong reason for lying, would not lie.


she believed in God, and was now ready to die for Jesus Christ, in the
eternal gladness that there was such a person as God and such a person
as Jesus Christ.

Opinion is all that can result from argument, and his opinion
concerning God, even if you got it set right, would not be knowledge
of God, and would be worth nothing; while, if a man knows God, his
opinion is either right, or on the nearest way to be right.

Talk to Richard of the God you love, the beautiful, the strong, the
true, the patient, the forgiving, the loving; the one childlike,
eternal power and Godhead, who would die himself and kill you rather
than have you false and mean and selfish.

A God that could be proved, would not be worth proving. Make his
thoughts dwell on such a God as he must feel would be worth
having. Wake the notion of a God such as will draw him to wish there
were such a God. There are many religious people who will tell you
there is no such God as I mean; but God will love you for believing
that he is as good and true as you can think.

The unprovable mystery out of which come the things provable, has for
them no interest, they say, because it is unprovable: they take for
granted that therefore it is unknowable.

If intellect be the highest power, then the men of proof are the
wisest; if there be something deeper than intellect, causing and
including it, if there be a creative power of which our intellect is
but a faint reflex, then the child of that power, the one who
acknowledges and loves and obeys that power, will be the one to
understand it.


"Say then, that he might be both strong and good, and have some reason
for allowing, or even causing it, which those who suffer will
themselves one day justify, ready for the sake of it to go through all
the suffering again.


I fear most clergymen are less human, therefore less divine, in the

They do, however, serve a little, I think, even as the rags of a

he could not get rid of the thought that what he had done was not
quite the thing for a gentleman to do. His trouble was not that he had
wronged Richard, but that he had wronged himself, had not acted like
his ideal of himself. He did not think of what was right, but of what
befitted a gentleman. Such a man is in danger of doing many things
unbefitting a gentleman. For the measure of a gentleman is not a man's
ideal of himself.


A man may send his gaze over the clear heaven, and suspect no God;
when the stifling cloud comes down, folds itself about him, shuts from
him the expanse of the universe, he begins to long for a hand, a sign,
some shadow of presence.


For no one can be saved, as he who knows his master would be saved,
without the will being supreme in the matter, without the choosing to
fulfill all righteousness, to resist the wrong, to do the
right. Wingfold never built much on bed-repentance.


thousands will do what the priests and scribes say he commands, for

So long as a man is satisfied, he seeks nothing; when a fresh gulf is
opened in his being, he must rise and find wherewithal to fill it. Our

fill them.


priding themselves on the good he has created in them, while they
refuse to make it their own by obeying it when they are disinclined.


He is in us all the time, else we could never move to seek him. It is
true that only by perfect faith in him can we be saved, for nothing
but perfect faith in him is salvation; there is no good but him, and
not to be one with that good by perfect obedience, is to be unsaved;
but one better thought concerning him, the poorest desire to draw near
him, is an approach to him.


to make him such that he could bear to regard himself; to make him
such that he could righteously consent to be. The only thing that can
reassure a man in respect of the mere fact of his existence, is to
know himself started on the way to grow better, with the hope of help
from the source of his being: how should he by himself better that
which he was powerless to create?


By actively willing the will of God, and doing what of it lies to his
doing, the man takes the share offered him in his own making, in his
own becoming.


In willing actively and operatively to be that which he was made in
order to be, he becomes creative—so far as a man may. In this kind
also he becomes like his Father in heaven.

The thing most alien to the true idea of humanity, is the notion that
