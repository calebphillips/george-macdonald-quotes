Nothing is inexorable but love.  Love which will yield to prayer is imperfect
and poor.  Nor is it then the love that yields, but its alloy.

It is not love that grants a boon unwillingly; still less is it love that
answers a prayer to the wrong and hurt of him who prays.

For love loves unto purity.  Love has ever in view the absolute loveliness of
that which it beholds.  Where loveliness is incomplete, and love cannot love its
fill of loving, it spends itself to make more lovely, that it may love more; it
strives for perfection, even that itself may be perfected -- not in itself, but
in the object.  As it was love that first created humanity, so even human love,
in proportion to its divinity, will go on creating the beautiful for its own
outpouring.  There is nothing eternal but that which loves and can be loved, and
love is ever climbing towards the consummation when such shall be the universe,
imperishable, divine.
