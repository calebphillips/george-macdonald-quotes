To do a man good in any way, you must sympathise with him-that is, know what he feels, and reflect the feeling in your own mirror; and to be a good doctor, one must love to heal; must honour the art of the physician and rejoice in it; must give himself to it, that he may learn all of it that he can-from its root of love to its branches of theory, and its leaves and fruits of healing.
