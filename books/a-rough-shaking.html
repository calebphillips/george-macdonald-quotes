the good man never wrote or read a sermon, but talked to his people as one who would meet what was in them with what was in him.

<p>
Happy is he that does not think of himself before the hour when he becomes conscious of the bliss of being loved.
LOCATION: 171734
</p>

<p>
There are thousands for whom a blow is a better thing than
expostulation, persuasion, or any sort of kindness. They are such that
nothing but a blow will set their door ajar for love to get in.  That
is why hardships, troubles, disappointments, and all kinds of pain and
suffering, are sent to so many of us. We are so full of ourselves, and
feel so grand, that we should never come to know what poor creatures
we are, <b>never begin to do better</b>, but for the knock-down blows that
the loving God gives us. We do not like them, but he does not spare us
for that.
</p>

<p>
To fall in with the work of the glad creator, and help him in it&#x2013;that is the only ambition worth having. It may not look a grand thing to do it in a caravan, but it takes the mind of Christ to do it anywhere.

the boy was a rare gentleman&#x2013;unwilling another should have more that he might have less of the disagreeable.
LOCATION: 174653
</p>

<p>
When we ask for something we want, it may be a thing God does not care to give us; but he likes us to speak to him about it. If it is good for us, he will give it us; if it is not good, he will not give it to us, for it would hurt us.
LOCATION: 174899
</p>

<p>
To know a human being one must be human&#x2013;that is, the divine must be strong in him.
LOCATION: 174995
</p>

<p>
No gentleman would write his remarks on the margins of another person's book; no lady would brush her hair as she read one of her own.
LOCATION: 175494
</p>

<p>
<b>a man ranks, not according to the thing he does, but according to the</b>
<b>way he does it. In life it is far higher to do an inferior thing well
than to do a superior thing passably</b>.
</p>

<p>
Whatever he read, he read from the point of practice. In history or
romance he saw&#x2013;not merely what a man ought to be or do, but what he
himself must, at that moment, be or do. There is a very common sort of
man calling himself practical, but neglecting to practise the most
important things, who would laugh at the idea of Clare being
practical, seeing he did not trouble his head about money, or "getting
on in the world"&#x2013;what servants call "bettering themselves;" but such
a practical man will find he has been but a practical fool.
<b>Clare took heed to do what was right, and grow a better man. Such a life is the
only really practical one</b>.
</p>

<p>
One of the causes and signs of Clare's manliness was, that he never
aimed at being a man. Many men continue childish because they are
always trying to act like men, instead of simply trying to do right.
</p>

<p>
He had had a rough shaking. The earthquake had come and gone, and come
again and gone a many times. But <b>the shaking earth was his nurse, and
she taught him to dwell in a world that cannot be shaken</b>.
