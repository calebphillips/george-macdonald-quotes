He had, on the contrary, always cherished a strong faith in his own honour. But faith in a thing, in an idea, in a notion, is no proof, or even sign that the thing actually exists: in the present case it had no root except in the man's thought of himself, in his presentation to himself of his own reflected self.

Even to begin the purification without which his moral and spiritual being must perish eternally, he must dare to look on himself as he was: he would not recognize himself, and thought he lay and would lie hid from all.

And so, unrepentant, he remained unforgiven, and continued a hypocrite and the slave of sin.

"Inasmuch as ye did it to one of the least of these, ye did it to me!" insisted her hostess. "That doesna apply, ma'am," objected Isy. "I'm nane o' his!" "Who is then? Who was it he came to save? Are you not one of his lost sheep? Are you not weary and heavy-laden? Will you never let him feel at home with you? Are you to say who he is to love and who he isn't? Are you to tell him who are fit to be counted his, and who are not good enough?"

disciple--that the chief end of his conscious life must be to live in His presence, and keep his affections ever, afresh and constantly, turning toward him in hope and aspiration.

To have food to give them, he must think! To think, he must have peace! to have peace, he must forget himself! to forget himself, he must repent, and walk in the truth! to walk in the truth, he must love God and his neighbour!--Even

Ignorant creatures go about asking why God permits evil: we know why!
It may be He could with a word cause evil to cease--but would that be
to create good? The word might make us good like oxen or harmless
sheep, but would that be a goodness worthy of him who was made in the
image of God? If a man ceased to be capable of evil, he must cease to
be a man! What would the goodness be that could not help being
good--that had no choice in the matter, but must be such because it
was so made? God chooses to be good, else he would not be God: man
must choose to be good, else he cannot be the son of God! Herein we
see the grand love of the Father of men--that he gives them a share,
and that share as necessary as his own, in the making of themselves!
Thus, and thus only, that is, by willing the good, can they become
'partakers of the divine nature!' Satan said, 'Ye shall be as gods,
knowing good and evil!' God says, 'Ye shall be as gods, knowing good
and evil, and choosing the good.' For the sake of this, that we may
come to choose the good, all the discipline of the world exists.
