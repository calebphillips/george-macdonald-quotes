* There is nothing for developing even the common intellect like
  obedience, that is, duty done. Those who obey are soon wiser than
  all their lessons; while from those who do not, will be taken away
  even what knowledge they started with.
* But the reason why you do not trust him more is that you obey him
    so little. If you would only, ask what God would have you to do,
    you would soon find your confidence growing.
* To him that obeys well, the truth comes easy; to him who does
      not obey, it comes not, or comes in forms of fear and dismay.
* When we cease listening to the cries of self-seeking and self-care,
  then the voice that was there all the time enters into our ears. It
  is the voice of the Father speaking to his child, never known for
  what it is until the child begins to obey it.
* so long as we obey the light in us, and that light is not darkness,
  we can't go wrong. If we should mistake, he will turn things round
  for us; and if we be to blame, he will let us see
* And remember that for the Divine Sonship on earth perfect knowledge
  was not necessary, only perfect confidence, absolute obedience,
  utter holiness. There is a great tendency in our sinful natures to
  put knowledge and power on a level with goodness.
* To one who has learned of all things to desire deliverance from
  himself, a nursery in which the children are humored and scolded and
  punished instead of being taught obedience, looks like a moral
  slaughter-house.
* The dawn of reason will doubtless help to develop obedience; but
  obedience is yet more necessary to the development of reason. To
  require of a child only what he can understand the reason of, is
  simply to help him to make himself his own God--that is a devil.
*  for generations the faith, so called, of the family had been dying
   down, simply because all that time it had sent out no fresh root of
   obedience
* He does not care for the praise that comes before obedience!
* Such a rough shaking of so-called faith, has been of endless service to many, chiefly by exposing the insecurity of all foundations of belief, save that which is discovered in digging with the spade of obedience.
* The whole question is how much we understand, and understanding, obey him.
