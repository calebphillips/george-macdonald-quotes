* There is nothing for developing even the common intellect like
  obedience, that is, duty done. Those who obey are soon wiser than
  all their lessons; while from those who do not, will be taken away
  even what knowledge they started with.
* But the reason why you do not trust him more is that you obey him
  so little. If you would only, ask what God would have you to do,
  you would soon find your confidence growing.
* To him that obeys well, the truth comes easy; to him who does
  not obey, it comes not, or comes in forms of fear and dismay.
* so long as we obey the light in us, and that light is not darkness,
  we can't go wrong. If we should mistake, he will turn things round
  for us; and if we be to blame, he will let us see
* He does not care for the praise that comes before obedience!
* The whole question is how much we understand, and understanding,
  obey him.
* "But what is the right tune of a body's life, father?" "The will of
  God, my boy." "But how is a person to know that, father?" "By trying
  to do what he knows of it already. Everybody has a different kind of
  tune in his life, and no one can find out another's tune for him,
  though he may help him to find it for himself." "But aren't we to
  read the Bible, father?" "Yes, if it's in order to obey it. To read
  the Bible thinking to please God by the mere reading of it, is to
  think like a heathen." "And aren't we to say our prayers, father?"
  "We are to ask God for what we want. If we don't want a thing, we
  are only
* God gives us all our business, and the business which is common to humanity is more peculiarly God's business than that which is one man's and not another's--because it lies nearer the root, and is essential. It does not matter whether a man is a farmer or a physician, but it greatly matters whether he is a good son, a good husband, and so on.



* When we cease listening to the cries of self-seeking and self-care,
  then the voice that was there all the time enters into our ears. It
  is the voice of the Father speaking to his child, never known for
  what it is until the child begins to obey it.
* And remember that for the Divine Sonship on earth perfect knowledge
  was not necessary, only perfect confidence, absolute obedience,
  utter holiness. There is a great tendency in our sinful natures to
  put knowledge and power on a level with goodness.
* To one who has learned of all things to desire deliverance from
  himself, a nursery in which the children are humored and scolded and
  punished instead of being taught obedience, looks like a moral
  slaughter-house.
* The dawn of reason will doubtless help to develop obedience; but
  obedience is yet more necessary to the development of reason. To
  require of a child only what he can understand the reason of, is
  simply to help him to make himself his own God--that is a devil.
*  for generations the faith, so called, of the family had been dying
   down, simply because all that time it had sent out no fresh root of
   obedience
* Such a rough shaking of so-called faith, has been of endless service to many, chiefly by exposing the insecurity of all foundations of belief, save that which is discovered in digging with the spade of obedience.
